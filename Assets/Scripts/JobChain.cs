/*
 *
 *
 * Given a NativeArray<int> of size N filled with positive integers, the class below filters the values which are powers of two.
 * The operation is asynchronous and when the operation is completed and the result is ready, the caller is notified through the callback given.
 *
 * The operation is divided into two steps:
 * 
 * The first step is to generate a mask array of size N. The value at an index is 1 if the corresponding value in the source array is a power of two, otherwise 0.
 * 
 * The second step is to filter the values in the source array using the mask generated in the first step.
 * The resulting data should contain the original value if it is a power of two, otherwise 0.
 *
 * The jobs can take as long is they need. The operation should not hang the main thread by waiting for jobs to complete.
 * Burst compilation should be used on the jobs.
 * The operations inside the jobs should be as optimized as possible. Relevant attributes should be used to maximize performance
 * The original array should not be modified.
 * When the result array is ready, invoke the given callback with the result.
 *
 * Note that there is a dependency between the outputs and inputs of the two jobs.
 *
 * Implement the class below and the described jobs, according to the constraints given above.
