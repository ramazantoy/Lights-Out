/*
 * 
 * The SomeBehaviour class below holds a serialized reference to another MonoBehaviour which is in the same scene.
 * On Start, it performs some operations that are dependent on this OtherBehaviour.
 *
 * Later in development, these two behaviours were separated and were moved to different scenes.
 * The dependency still remains, therefore SomeBehaviour class should somehow get the reference of OtherBehaviour.
 * In the future, there can be more behaviours that are dependent each other. There can be cyclic dependencies in some cases.
 *
 * Implement your simple and generalized solution to this problem, so that similar problems that can be encountered in the future can be solved easily. 
 * 
 * Make sure you describe your code and intentions clearly.
